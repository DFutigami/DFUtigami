# 👋 Hi there - I'm Debora or Debbie


## 🌟 Welcome to my GitHub profile!


### 👩🏽‍💻 About me

I'm student at **Southern States University** and I'm pursuing more knolodge in **_Information Technology_**. I enjoy learning about current innovations such as cloud computing,
artificial intelligence. I also like to learn how these technologies can benefit us on a daily basis.


### 🐙/🐱 GitHub and ☁️ Cloud Computing

My knowledge of GitHub was limited to creating and participating in discussions. But I know that as I gain more knowlodge, it will be possible to have a central hub for versio
control and collaboration on my academic and personal IT projects. With this tool, I can track progress, manage changes, and collaborate with colleagues.

I'm also curious to learn hor to use **GitHub Actions** to automate workflows and deploy cloud applications. Not to mention learning how to integrate GitHub with **Docker**, 
**Terraform**, and **serveless functions** for infrastructure as code an cloud automation.


The more I study and learn about tools like **AWS**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud**, the more I understand that GitHub can be a great differentiator for <ins>connecting
code repositories to pipelines, containers, and serveless architetures</ins>. This allows for rapid innovation, scability, and a simple deploy process.
